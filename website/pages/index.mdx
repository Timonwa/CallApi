# Introduction

CallApi is an extra-lightweight wrapper over the Fetch API that provides convenient options for making HTTP requests while keeping the API familiar with the Fetch API.

It takes in a `url` and a `request` options object, like Fetch API, but with additional options to make your life easier. Check out the [API Reference](/api-reference) for a quick look at each option.
