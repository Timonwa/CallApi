# Introduction

Welcome to the CallApi Documentation

## What is CallApi?

CallApi is an extra-lightweight wrapper over fetch that provides convenient options for making HTTP requests, while keeping the API familiar to the fetch api.

It takes in a url and a request options object, just like fetch, but with some additional options to make your life easier. Check out the [API Reference](/api-reference) for a quick look at each option.
