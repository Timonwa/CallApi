# Getting Started

CallApi provides a familiar experience for making HTTP requests, similar to the Fetch API, but with added conveniences for easier response handling.

## Installation

CallApi is available as an NPM package. You can install it using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/). You can also use it directly in the browser via a CDN.

### Using npm (recommended)

To install CallApi using npm, run the following command:

```js npm2yarn copy
npm install @zayne-labs/callapi
```

Then, import CallApi into your project:

```js
import { callApi } from "@zayne-labs/callapi";
```

### Without npm

To use CallApi without npm, import it directly into your JavaScript files via a CDN by using a script tag with the `type="module"` attribute:

```html
<script type="module">
    import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi";
</script>
```

If you want to use a specific version, you can specify it in the URL like this:

```html
<script type="module">
    import { callApi } from "https://esm.run/@zayne-labs/callapi@0.7.7";
</script>
```

## Quick Start

CallApi is designed to work just like the native Fetch API, with some added conveniences to make your life easier. The best part? You don't need to handle the response manually. Instead, you can destructure the result directly, getting access to both the `data` and `error` in one step.

```js
const { data, error } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

You can pass the same request options as you would with the Fetch API, maintaining the familiar syntax you're used to.

In addition to `data` and `error`, you can also access the entire response object if needed:

```js
const { data, error, response } = await callApi("url", fetchOptions);
```

To make development even smoother, especially with autocompletion and type safety, check out the [TypeScript section](/advanced#usage-with-typescript) for more details on using CallApi with TypeScript.
