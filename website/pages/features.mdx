# Features

CallApi provides several features. Let's explore them in this section.

## ✔️ Easy Error Handling

CallApi offers unified error handling through an `error` object, which captures both HTTP errors (errors coming as a response from the API) and standard JavaScript errors.

The `error` object contains the following properties:

1. `name`: A string indicating the type of error (e.g., 'TypeError', 'SyntaxError', 'HTTPError').
2. `message`: The error message describing what went wrong.
3. `errorData`: The error data, which can be an error response from the API or a standard JavaScript error object.

For `HTTP errors`:

-  `name` is set to "HTTPError"
-  An additional `errorData` property contains the error response data from the API.

For `non-HTTP errors` (e.g., TypeError, SyntaxError):

-  `name` reflects the specific JavaScript error type (i.e., 'TypeError', 'SyntaxError')
-  The `errorData` property contains the original JavaScript Error object.

This structure allows you to easily identify and handle different types of errors that may occur during API calls.

```js
const { data, error } = await callApi("some-url");

console.log(error.name);
console.log(error.message);
// Will reference the would contain the parsed error response data if it is an HTTPError, else it would just reference the corresponding js Error object
console.log(error.errorData);
```

## ✔️ Automatic Requests Cancellation

This basically implies there's no race conditions by default using `callApi`.

`CallApi` uses an internal request management system to ensure that only the most recent request to a given URL, with the same fetch option, is processed. This helps in preventing the dreaded race conditions.

### How This Feature Works in Detail

1. When a request is made, CallApi's internals check if there's an ongoing request to the same URL with the same fetch options.
2. If a pending request exists, it's automatically cancelled.
3. Then, the new request is sent.
4. This process is repeated to ensure that only the latest request to that same URL is allowed to proceed.

You can see this in action via the image below:

### Key Takeaways

-  **Automatic Cancellation**: When multiple requests are made to the same URL in quick succession, `callApi` automatically cancels any pending previous requests, allowing only the latest request to proceed.
-  **Race Condition Prevention**: This mechanism eliminates race conditions that can occur when rapid, successive API calls are made, such as during fast typing in a search input or multiple button clicks.
-  **Ideal for React Hooks**: This feature is particularly useful when `callApi` is used within React's `useEffect` hook or similar scenarios where component updates might trigger multiple API calls.
-  **Configurable**: If you prefer to handle request management differently, you can disable this feature by setting `{ cancelRedundantRequests: false }` in the fetch options.
-  **Manual Cancellation**: You can manually cancel ongoing requests to a specific URL by passing an abort controller signal to `callApi` (just like with `fetch`) as an option and abort the request whenever you want to.

### Using `AbortController` to manually cancel request:

```js copy
const controller = new AbortController();

callApi("some-url", { signal: controller.signal });

controller.abort();
```

## ✔️ Query search params

You can add query object as an option and `callApi` will create a query string for you automatically.

```js copy
callApi("some-url", {
	query: {
		param1: "value1",
		param2: "to encode",
	},
});

// The above request can be written in Fetch like this:
fetch("some-url?param1=value1&param2=to%20encode");
```

## ✔️ Content-Type Generation

`CallApi` takes care of setting the `Content-Type` for you based on the body content. Here's how it works:

-  **Automatic Content-Type Setting**: `CallApi` sets the `Content-Type` automatically depending on your body data.
   Data types eligible for this automatic setting include:

-  Object
-  Query Strings
-  FormData

-  **Object/JSON Handling**: If you pass in an object as the request body, `CallApi` will set `Content-Type` to `application/json` for you. It will also handle `JSON.stringify` process for you (although you can always pass in a custom stringifier/serializer if you want), so you don't have to do it yourself.

```js copy
callApi.post("some-url", {
	body: { message: "Good game" },
});

// The above request is equivalent to this
fetch("some-url", {
	method: "post",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
	body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Good game" }),
});
```

-  **Query String Handling**: If you pass in a query string as the request body, `CallApi` will ensure the `Content-Type` is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for you.

   `CallApi` also provides a `toQueryString` utility that helps you convert objects to query strings, for extra convenience.

```js copy
import { toQueryString } from "@zayne-labs/callapi/utils";

callApi("some-url", {
	method: "POST",
	body: toQueryString({ message: "Good game" }),
});

// The above request is equivalent to this
fetch("some-url", {
	method: "post",
	headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
	body: "message=Good%20game",
});
```

-  **FormData Handling**: If you pass in a `FormData` object as the request body, `callApi` will let the native fetch function handle the `Content-Type`.
   Generally, this will be `multipart/form-data` with the default `boundary`.

```js copy
const data = new FormData(formElement);

callApi("some-url", { body: data });
```

## ✔️ Authorization Headers

When using `callApi`, you can conveniently generate Authorization Headers by providing an `auth` property:

-  If you pass in a `string`, typically for tokens, `callApi` will generate a Bearer Auth header.

-  If you pass in an `object`, you have two options:

   -  Use `bearer` to generate a Bearer Auth header.
   -  Use `token` to generate a Token Auth header.

-  Passing a string:

```js
callApi("some-url", { auth: "token12345" });

// Equivalent to the following in fetch:
fetch("some-url", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer token12345` },
});
```

-  Passing an object:

```js
// For Bearer Auth
callApi("some-url", { auth: { bearer: "token12345" } });

// Or

// For Token Auth
callApi("some-url", { auth: { token: "token12345" } });

// Equivalent to the following in fetch:

// For Bearer Auth
fetch("some-url", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Bearer token12345` },
});

// Or

// For Token Auth
fetch("some-url", {
	headers: { Authorization: `Token token12345` },
});
```

This simplifies handling authorization headers, ensuring your requests are authenticated correctly.

## ✔️ Handling the Response Format

`CallApi` supports all response types offered by the fetch API, such as `json`, `text`, `blob`, `formData`, etc. This means you don't need to manually handle `response.json()`, `response.text()`, `response.formData()`, etc.

You can configure the response type you prefer by using the `responseType` option. By default, it's set to `json`.

```js
// Json (default)
const { data } = await callApi("url", { responseType: "json" });
// Text
const { data } = await callApi("url", { responseType: "text" });
// Blob, etc
const { data } = await callApi("url", { responseType: "blob" });

// Doing this in fetch would imply:
const response = await fetch("some-url");

const data = await response.json(); // Or response.text() or response.blob() etc
```

This simplifies fetching data from responses, allowing you to specify the format you want directly.

#### Custom response parser

if you want to parse a response with a custom function other than the default `JSON.parse`, you can pass a custom parser function to the `responseParser` option.

```js
const { data, error } = await callApi("url", {
	responseParser: customResponseParser,
});
```

Or even better, provide it as a base option for `callApi`.

```js
const callAnotherApi = callApi.create({
	responseParser: customResponseParser,
});
```

#### Custom body serializer

You could also provide a custom serializer/stringifier, other the default `JSON.stringify`, for objects passed to the request body via the `bodySerializer` option.

```js
const callAnotherApi = callApi.create({
	bodySerializer: customBodySerializer,
});
```

These options give you flexibility in handling both responses and request bodies in the way that best suits your needs.

## ✔️ Validator Function

`CallApi` also provides a `responseValidator` option, allowing you to pass in a function that validates the data returned from the server.

A good use case for this would be to use a library like Zod and pass its schema `parse` or `safeParse` function to validate the data.

If your validator function throws an error and you have the `throwOnError` option set to `true`, you will need to check and handle the errors in a `catch` block. However, if `throwOnError` is set to `false` (default), it will just return the error object as usual.

```js
const callMainApi = callApi.create({
	responseValidator: zodSchema.parse, // or zodSchema.safeParse or any other validator you wish to use
});
```

This feature helps ensure the data you receive meets your validation criteria, making error handling more robust and predictable.
